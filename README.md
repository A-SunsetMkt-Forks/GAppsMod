# GoogleDialerMod

The ultimate All-In-One Utility to tweak Google Dialer behaviour.

# How do I use it?

Allow root access, choose what you want, open / force close Google Dialer app a couple of times, and then forget about it :)

Always make sure you are using the latest Google Dialer beta from the Play Store to enjoy the latest features.

There is no need to keep GoogleDialerMod installed after applying the desired changes, because they (should) survive Google Dialer updates / reinstalls over time.

# How does it work?

This app uses SQLite commands to override some flags related to Google Dialer into the Google Play Services. 

Google Play Services control a lot of features inside Google Dialer. Some of them are core functionality of Google Dialer, some of them are upcoming feature that are simply not yet released.

What this app does is making some SQLite queries in order to alter some features of Google Dialer.

# Example of available commands

- Force enable call recording feature even with unsupported devices or in unsupported countries
- Silence annoying call recording "registration has started / ended" sounds

And much more coming soon :)
